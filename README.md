## üîÆ Professional Journey and Experience
- Always had a passion for games and learning how they worked. As a backer for the project **Star Citizen**, I watched all the development reports closely where they described their processes and it started to get me interested in knowing more and more. They developed a bug reporting tool for the project that everyone could use, so I started reporting bugs, adding videos, and being active and interacting with the development team as a backer. I then got invited to the Evocati program and this inspired me to pursue jobs in the Software Quality Assurance field as I enjoyed what I was doing for a hobby.
- Began my journey in the Software Quality Analysis field in a local startup as an intern while pursuing my bachelor's degree, having an amazing opportunity to participate in the project lifecycle from beginning to end. I assisted with requirement gathering, functional documentation, testing, and project release.
- A year later got an opportunity to work on an international project in a much bigger company, an incredible chance to expand my horizons. For 2.5 years, I gained extensive experience in E2E testing, automation, data-driven decision making, project coordination, and project planning, while also having a chance to put my spoken English to good use in the workday.
- I then made the decision to move towards a role that allows me to exercise my desire to code more directly, and my creative drive to build something that people enjoy, combining my software testing expertise with my passion for coding. Currently pursuing a job in the games industry.
