# 📝 Projects
## [Unreal Engine 5 - Third Person extraction game (WIP)]
- This project combines my previous studies into a single project with a gameplay loop involving travelling to different places on the map, killing enemies and bringing back the loot to the base to complete the mission.
- Loot system (Collect / Drop / Transfer to containers back and forth)
- Combat system (basic shooting and AI)
- Mission system (gives an objective and counts it to complete when it was satisfied)

## [CryEngine - Enhanced Flight Controller](https://github.com/matheusperches/cryprototype)
- Practicing 3D math with a fun 6DOF spaceship simulated with impulse generators. This is a much improved version from my first flight system made in Unreal.
- CryEngine always intrigued me, so I decided to learn the basics of the engine by doing this project. I am porting this work over back to Unreal to develop a more fleshed out game demo that combines on foot and vehicle gameplay with looting.

## [UE4 - Six Degrees of Freedom spaceship](https://github.com/matheusperches/PlaygroundProj)
- An Unreal Engine 4 project in C++ about a flight controller for spaceships.
- Developed a fully customizable spaceship with individually tunable accelerations and a finite boost mechanic which can also be completely tweaked.
- Time attack gamemode which has the player capturing all 20 checkpoints to win.

## [UE4 - Inventory system](https://github.com/matheusperches/UE4-Inventory-Blueprints)
- An Unreal Engine 4 project in Blueprints, creating an inventory system with lootables.
- Followed guides and experimented with different approaches, this was my entry point into game engines.

## [Data Exploration - Star Citizen 3.22 vs 3.23 Ship Price Comparison](https://github.com/matheusperches/sc_ship_prices_322_323)
- A data exploration on the game balance adjustments to assets sold to players using in-game currency, to understand the biggest changes and how they could affect player buying decisions.

## [Fetal Health Study](https://github.com/matheusperches/Fetal-health-study)
- A fetal health prediction model made during my Software Architecture course.

## [Music Recommendation Model](https://github.com/matheusperches/MusicRecommendation)
- A Machine Learning model to predict music preferences based on age and gender.

## [Auto-Installer](https://github.com/matheusperches/Auto-Installer)
- An auto installer made with C# for one of the teams I worked with.

## 🔮 Professional Journey and Experience
- Always had a passion for games and learning how they worked. As a backer for the project **Star Citizen**, I watched all the development reports closely where they described their processes and it started to get me interested in knowing more. They developed a tool that the backers could use to report bugs, so I started using it by adding videos, detailed descriptions, reproduction steps, while being active and interacting with the development team as a backer. I then got invited to the Evocati program, their more private testing group where builds were released earlier, and this inspired me to pursue jobs in the Software Quality Assurance field as I enjoyed what I was doing for a hobby.
- Began my journey in the Software Quality Analysis field in a local startup as an intern while pursuing my bachelor's degree, having an amazing opportunity to participate in the project lifecycle from beginning to end. I assisted with requirement gathering, functional documentation, testing, and project release.
- A year later got an opportunity to work on an international project in a much bigger company, an incredible chance to expand my horizons. For 2.5 years, I gained extensive experience in E2E testing, automation, data-driven decision making, project coordination, and project planning, while also having a chance to put my spoken English to good use.
- This led me to pursue a job in the games industry as a gamneplay programmer, as I want to exercise my coding skills in a creative environment.
