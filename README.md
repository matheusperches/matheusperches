 ## üîÆ **Professional journey and Experience**
 - Always had a passion for games and learning how they worked. As a backer for the project Star Citizen, I watched all the development reports closely where they described their processes and it started to get me interested in knowing more and more. They developed a bug reporting tool for the project that everyone could use, so I started reporting bugs, adding videos and being active and interacting with the development team as a backer. I then got invited for the Evocati program and this inspired me to purpuse jobs in the Software Quality Assurance field as I enjoyed what I was doing for a hobby.
- Began my journey in the Software Quality Analysis field in a local startup as an intern while pursuing my bachelor degree, having an amazing opportunity to participate in the project lifecycle from beginning to end. I assisted with requirement gathering, functional documentation, testing and shipping.
- A year later got an opportunity to work on an international project in a much bigger company, an incredible chance to expand my horizons. For 2.5 years, I got extensive experience in E2E testing, automation, data-driven decision making, project coordination and project planning, while also having a chance to put my spoken English to good use in the workday.
- I then made the decision to move towards a role that allows me to exercise my desire to code more directly, and my creative drive to build something that people enjoy. I can now combine my software testing expertise with my passion for coding, to build and test my own software with more confidence.

## üß™ **Tools and Technologies**
